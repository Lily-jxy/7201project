# 7201project I really try so hard on this project by myself!!!
The data is downloaded from Kaggle: \
My data is more than 500MB, which is too big to upload, but I can upload the description file\
And when you download the data from Kaggle, you have to rename it to "payment_data.csv", sorry for the inconvenience.\

\And what I hand in include the report, ipynb and html (for code), PowerPoint, description dataset, \
                             kaggle link with the original dataset, \
                             and the four visualization graph of decision tree and random forest\
                             (the other visualization graph is in the code part)\
                             (and my ppt might be a little mess because I made a lot of animation inside to save time)\
                             (really thank you all for teaching and helping me this semester!!!Love‚ù§)
